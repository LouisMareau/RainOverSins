# RainOverSins

This project is an original video game created by myself (Louis Mareau). 
For the time being, this game is being developped entirely on Unity 3D (ver. 2020.1).
While the concept was thought and worked on around March 2015, the development didn't started before August 2020 for financial, time and experience reasons.

This project is being developped by only 1 person so far but might grow as budget evolves.

While the progress is still slow, it is being worked on actively every week.
